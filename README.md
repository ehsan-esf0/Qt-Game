# 🛩️ Greedy Game

Welcome to Greedy Game! In this exciting game, you have to hit the enemy planes as much as you can to get more points. ☠️ If 3 planes leave the map, the game ends and you have to try again. Let's dive into the game mechanics and features.

## 🎮 Game Defense System

The game has two types of defense systems: shooters and bombs.

### 💣 Shooters

There are four types of shooters:

1️⃣ **Shooter (turret_q8)**: Fires at the enemy that is ahead of all others.

⚒️ **All of these appear randomly in a box on the side of the page and can be placed on the game map. The defense systems need iron to be placed on the map, which increases with time in the game.** ⚒️
